# A simple code to help you in WORDLE
In the last few days, I started playing WORDLE so I made a very simple code to be able to slightly facilitate the daily search of the proposed word.
I created this algorithm out of pure curiosity and desire to write lines of C ++ code, the programming language I'm learning at [school](https://www.liceodongnocchi.eu).
The algorithm finds the possible words, discarding those that are not possible according to the letters entered by the user.
